This repository contains the R scripts used for performing the simulations and data analyses described in Hartwig et al. (2024), currently under peer-review. Preprint available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10156.

This repository contains the following scripts:

- 1) Simulation_scenario_1.R: This script allows replicating simulation scenario 1 (see the supplementary material in Hartwig et al. (2024) for details).
- 2) Simulation_scenario_2.R: This script allows replicating simulation scenario 2 (see the supplementary material in Hartwig et al. (2024) for details).
- 3) Simulation_scenario_3.R: This script allows replicating simulation scenario 3 (see the supplementary material in Hartwig et al. (2024) for details).
- 4) Model_selection.R: This script allows replicating the model selection process used in the empirical data analysis (see the supplementary material in Hartwig et al. (2024) for details).
